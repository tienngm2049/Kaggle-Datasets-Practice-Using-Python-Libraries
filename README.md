# Kaggle Practice Python Libraries

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my practice projects with datasets extracted from Kaggle. The main objective of this repository is to enhance my skills in data analysis using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other statistical techniques.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:

1. Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for each practice project
2. Dataset files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.) used in the projects
3. README.md (this file) providing an overview of the repository

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook files and perform the data analysis, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly & Dash
- SciPy & Statmodels

You can install these libraries using the `pip` package manager by running the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly dash scipy statmodels 
```

## Projects

The repository includes various projects, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis. Some of the projects covered in this repository include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Performing data exploration, data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
2. Data Preprocessing - Applying data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling categorical variables using Pandas and NumPy.
3. Statistical Analysis - Conducting statistical analysis on datasets, including hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression analysis using statistical libraries.

Feel free to explore the projects and the accompanying Jupyter Notebook files to learn more about each topic.

## Usage

To use the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the analysis results.
5. Modify and experiment with the code to practice and enhance your data analysis skills.
